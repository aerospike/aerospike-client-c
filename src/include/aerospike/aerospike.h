/** 
 * @mainpage Aerospike C Client
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The Aerospike C client allows you to build C/C++ applications to store and retrieve data from the
 * Aerospike cluster. The C client is a smart client that periodically pings nodes for cluster
 * status and manages interactions with the cluster.  The following functionality is supported.
 *
 * - Database commands
 *   - Key/Value
 *   - Map/List collections
 *   - Batch read
 *   - Scan
 *   - Secondary index query
 *   - User defined Lua functions
 *   - Expression filters
 * - Both synchronous and asynchronous command models
 * - Asynchronous model supports the following event frameworks.
 *   - libev
 *   - libevent
 *   - libuv
 * - Thread safe API
 * - Shared memory cluster tend state for multi-process applications
 * - TLS secure sockets
 *
 * See <a href="modules.html">Modules</a> for an API overview.
 *
 * See <a href="http://www.aerospike.com/docs/client/c">Developer Guide</a> for installation
 * instructions and example code.

/**
 * The aerospike struct is used to connect and execute operations against an 
 * Aerospike database cluster.
 *
 * ## Configuration
 *
 * A client configuration is required to initialize an aerospike client.
 * See as_config for details on configuration options.
 * 
 * At least one seed host must be defined.
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * as_config config;
 * as_config_init(&config);
 * as_config_add_host(&config, "127.0.0.1", 3000);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Once connected to a host in the cluster, then client will gather information
 * about the cluster, including all other nodes in the cluster. So, all that
 * is needed is a single valid host.  Multiple hosts can still be provided in
 * case the first host is not currently active.
 * 
 * ## Initialization
 *
 * Initialization requires a configuration to bind to the client instance.
 *
 * The aerospike instance can be initialized via either:
 *
 * - aerospike_init() — Initialize a stack allocated aerospike instance.
 * - aerospike_new() — Create and initialize a heap allocated aerospike instance.
 *
 * Once initialized, the ownership of the as_config instance fields are transferred 
 * to the aerospike instance.  The user should never call as_config_destroy() directly.
 *
 * The following uses a stack allocated aerospike instance and initializes it
 * with aerospike_init():
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * aerospike as;
 * aerospike_init(&as, &config);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~
 * 
 * ## Connecting
 *
 * The client will be connected if `aerospike_connect()` completes successfully:
 * 
 * ~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * if (aerospike_connect(&as, &err) != AEROSPIKE_OK) {
 *   fprintf(stderr, "error(%d) %s at [%s:%d]", err.code, err.message, err.file, err.line);
 * }
 * ~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * The `err` parameter will be populated if an error occurs. See as_error for more information
 * on error handling.
 * 
 * An aerospike object internally keeps cluster state and maintains connection pools to the cluster. 
 * The same aerospike object should be reused by the application for database operations 
 * to a given cluster. 
 *
 * If the application requires connecting to multiple Aerospike clusters, the application must
 * create multiple aerospike objects, each connecting to a different cluster.
 * 
 * ## Disconnecting
 *
 * When the connection to the database is not longer required, then the 
 * connection to the cluster can be closed via `aerospike_close()`:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * aerospike_close(&as, &err);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * ## Destruction
 *
 * When the client is not longer required, the client and its resources should 
 * be releases via `aerospike_destroy()`:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 * aerospike_destroy(&as);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * @ingroup client_objects
