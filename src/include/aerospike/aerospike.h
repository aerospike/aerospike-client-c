struct as_cluster_s;

/**
 * 	An instance of @ref aerospike is required to connect to and execute 
 *	operations against an Aerospike Database cluster.
 *
 *	## Configuration
 *
 *	An initialized client configuration is required to initialize a 
 *	@ref aerospike client. See as_config for details on configuration options.
 *	
 *	At a minimum, a configuration needs to be initialized and have at least
 *	one host defined:
 *	
 *	~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 *	as_config config;
 *	as_config_init(&config);
 *	as_config_add_host(&config, "127.0.0.1", 3000);
 *	~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 *	Once connected to a host in the cluster, then client will gather information
 *	about the cluster, including all other nodes in the cluster. So, all that
 *	is needed is a single valid host.  Multiple hosts can still be provided in
 *	case the first host is not currently active.
 *	
 *	## Initialization
 *
 *	An initialized @ref aerospike object is required to connect to the 
 *	database. Initialization requires a configuration to bind to the client
 *	instance. 
 *
 *	The @ref aerospike object can be initialized via either:
 *
 * 	- aerospike_init() — Initialize a stack allocated @ref aerospike.
 *	- aerospike_new() — Create and initialize a heap allocated @ref aerospike.
 *
 *	Both initialization functions require a configuration.  Once initialized, the ownership
 *	of the as_config instance fields are transferred to @ref aerospike.  The user should never
 *	call as_config_destroy() directly.
 *
 *	The following uses a stack allocated @ref aerospike and initializes it
 *	with aerospike_init():
 *
 *	~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 *	aerospike as;
 *	aerospike_init(&as, &config);
 *	~~~~~~~~~~
 *	
 *	## Connecting
 *
 *	An application can connect to the database with an initialized
 *	@ref aerospike. The client will be connected if `aerospike_connect()` completes
 *	successfully:
 *	
 *	~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 *	if (aerospike_connect(&as, &err) != AEROSPIKE_OK) {
 *		fprintf(stderr, "error(%d) %s at [%s:%d]", err.code, err.message, err.file, err.line);
 *	}
 *	~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 *	The `err` parameter will be populated if an error while attempting to
 *	connect to the database. See as_error, for more information on error 
 *	handling.
 * 
 *	An aerospike object internally keeps cluster state and maintains connection pools to the cluster. 
 *	The same aerospike object should be reused by the application for database operations 
 *	to a given cluster. 
 *
 *	If the application requires connecting to multiple Aerospike clusters, the application must
 *	create multiple aerospike objects, each connecting to a different cluster.
 * 
 *	## Disconnecting
 *
 *	When the connection to the database is not longer required, then the 
 *	connection to the cluster can be closed via `aerospike_close()`:
 *
 *	~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 *	aerospike_close(&as, &err);
 *	~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 *	## Destruction
 *
 *	When the client is not longer required, the client and its resources should 
 *	be releases via `aerospike_destroy()`:
 *
 *	~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 *	aerospike_destroy(&as);
 *	~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 *	@ingroup client_objects
