/** 
 *	@defgroup scan_operations Scan Operations
 *	@ingroup client_operations
 *
 *	Aerospike Scan Operations provide the ability to scan all record of a 
 *	namespace and set in an Aerospike database. 
 *
 *	## Usage
 *
 *	Before you can execute a scan, you first need to define a scan using 
 *	as_scan. See as_scan for details on defining scans.
 *
 *	Once you have a scan defined, then you can execute the scan
 *	using either:
 *
 *	- aerospike_scan_foreach() — Execute a scan on the database, then process 
 *		the results.
 *	- aerospike_scan_background() — Send a scan to the database, and not wait 
 *		for completed. The scan is given an id, which can be used to query the
 *		scan status.
 *
 *	When aerospike_scan_foreach() is executed, it will process the results
 *	and create records on the stack. Because the records are on the stack, 
 *	they will only be available within the context of the callback function.
 *
 *	When aerospike_scan_background() is executed, the client will not wait for 
 *	results from the database. Instead, the client will be given a scan_id, 
 *	which can be used to query the scan status on the database via 
 *	aerospike_scan_info().
 *
 *	## Walk-through
 *	
 *	First, we build a scan using as_scan. The scan will be on the "test"
 *	namespace and "demo" set. We will select only bins "a" and "b" to be returned 
 *	for each record.
 *	
 *	~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 *	as_scan scan;
 *	as_scan_init(&scan, "test", "demo");
 *
 *	as_scan_select_inita(&scan, 2);
 *	as_scan_select(&scan, "a");
 *	as_scan_select(&scan, "B");
 *	~~~~~~~~~~
 *	
 *	Now that we have a scan defined, we want to execute it using 
 *	aerospike_scan_foreach().
 *	
 *	~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 *	if ( aerospike_scan_foreach(&as, &err, NULL, &scan, callback, NULL) != AEROSPIKE_OK ) {
 *		fprintf(stderr, "error(%d) %s at [%s:%d]", err.code, err.message, err.file, err.line);
 *	}
 *	~~~~~~~~~~
 *	
 *	The callback provided to the function above is implemented as:
 *	
 *	~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 *	bool callback(const as_val * val, void * udata) {
 *		as_record * rec = as_record_fromval(val);
 *		if ( !rec ) return false;
 *		fprintf("record contains %d bins", as_record_numbins(rec));
 *		return true;
 *	}
 *	~~~~~~~~~~
 *	
 *	An as_scan is simply a scan definition, so it does not contain any state,
 *	allowing it to be reused for multiple scan operations. 
 *	
 *	When you are finished with the scan, you should destroy the resources 
 *	allocated to it:
 *
 *	~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
 *	as_scan_destroy(&scan);
 *	~~~~~~~~~~
